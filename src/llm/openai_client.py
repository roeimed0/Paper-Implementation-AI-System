Placeholder for OpenAI API Client Implementation

NOT IMPLEMENTED

This file shows where the OpenAI client will be implemented
when real API integration is needed.

See mock_client.py for reference implementation of BaseLLMClient interface.

To implement:
1. Import openai library
2. Extend BaseLLMClient
3. Implement all abstract methods (initialize, cleanup, generate, etc.)
4. Add OpenAI-specific error handling (rate limits, content filters)
5. Integrate with rate limiter and cache manager

When ready to use:
- Install: pip install openai
- Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
- Change provider: "openai" in config/model_config.yaml

Placeholder for LLM Utility Functions

NOT IMPLEMENTED

This file shows where shared LLM utilities will be implemented.

Potential utilities:
- Prompt formatting and validation
- Response parsing helpers
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Token counting for different providers
- Cost calculation helpers
- Streaming response handlers
- Batch processing utilities

See mock_client.py for examples of how these utilities might be used.

To implement:
1. Identify common patterns across LLM clients
2. Extract shared functionality
3. Create reusable helper functions
4. Add comprehensive error handling
